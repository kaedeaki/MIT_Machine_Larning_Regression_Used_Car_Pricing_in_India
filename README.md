# Machine Learning Regression Used Car Pricing Model in ndia  

**Name of project**: Used Car Pricing Model in India  
**Aim**: To predict the price of used car with machine learning regression.  
**Language**: Python   
**Solution**: Used various methods such as XG Boost, Gradient Boost, Cat Boost, Ada Boost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Ledge regression, Lasso Regression, Linear Regression, and Statistical methods for pricing Models.  
**Results**: The best model is Gradient Boost and the performance is R-square 0.89 and RSME 3.6. Further analysis, created the plot of the difference between actual price and predicted price to see how the scatter dots like. Predicting price can be a useful tool in many real world scenarios such as Stock trading, Real estate, E-commerce, Supply chain, and Energy.
